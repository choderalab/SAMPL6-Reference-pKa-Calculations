Corrected results for 'protonated' structure in water:
pKa atom: 17

 # 	           Shell           	 pKa 	RMSD	 Contribution
---	---------------------------	-----	-----	--------------
1: 	imidazole as base          	 5.60	0.576	    42.38%
2: 	benzimidazole as base      	 5.25	0.662	    42.71%
3: 	heterocycle                	 4.90	0.837	    13.98%
4: 	Protonation of generic atom	 5.22	2.264	     0.93%

 Final weighted pKa value is 5.35
