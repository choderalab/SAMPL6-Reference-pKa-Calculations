# Invalidated structures
SM23_micro040 has the wrong state, invalidate all calculations. rebuild from sm23_micro020 and mimimize with mmff
SM23_micro019 has the wrong state, invalidate all calculations. rebuild from sm23_micro020 and mimimize with mmff
SM23_micro036 has the wrong state, invalidate all calculations. rebuild from sm23_micro020 and mimimize with mmff

SM18_micro055 has the wrong hydrogens, fix and rerun. rebuild from sm18_micro52 and minimize with mmff


minimizing SM24_micro030 with MMFF (macromodel), then rerun all calculations.
jag_SM21_micro034 conformation is strange. minimizing, rerun all calcs

jag_SM21_micro034 conformation is strange. minimizing with mmff, rerun all calcs
jag_SM21_micro033 conformation is strange. minimizing with mmff, rerun all calcs

SM03_micro021 has a weird structure. minimize with MMFF (has a weird lewis structure, so I minimized it with a different bond) and rerun all. 

SM06_micro004 has a weird geometry. rerunning with mmff minimized structure

SM18_micro065 minimized with mmff, rerun
