Corrected results for 'protonated' structure in water:
pKa atom: 29

 # 	                 Shell                 	 pKa 	RMSD	 Contribution
---	---------------------------------------	-----	-----	--------------
1: 	OH attached to heterocycle (with one N)	 9.68	0.844	    82.47%
2: 	Protonation of generic atom            	12.08	2.264	     5.99%
3: 	Protonation of sp2-like oxygen         	11.21	2.568	    11.55%

 Final weighted pKa value is 10.00
