Corrected results for 'protonated' structure in water:
pKa atom: 23

 # 	                 Shell                 	 pKa 	RMSD	 Contribution
---	---------------------------------------	-----	-----	--------------
1: 	OH attached to heterocycle (with one N)	 8.90	0.844	    82.50%
2: 	Protonation of generic atom            	 8.93	2.264	     5.97%
3: 	Protonation of sp2-like oxygen         	 8.49	2.568	    11.52%

 Final weighted pKa value is 8.86
