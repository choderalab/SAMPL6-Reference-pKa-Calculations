Corrected results for 'protonated' structure in water:
pKa atom: 17

 # 	           Shell           	 pKa 	RMSD	 Contribution
---	---------------------------	-----	-----	--------------
1: 	imidazole as base          	 3.84	0.576	    42.51%
2: 	benzimidazole as base      	 3.61	0.662	    42.43%
3: 	heterocycle                	 2.60	0.837	    14.11%
4: 	Protonation of generic atom	 3.43	2.264	     0.95%

 Final weighted pKa value is 3.56
