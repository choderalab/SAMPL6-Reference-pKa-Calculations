  then ALL processes must call "init" prior to termination.
  
  2. this process called "init", but exited without calling "finalize".
  By rule, all processes that call "init" MUST call "finalize" prior to
  exiting or it will be considered an "abnormal termination"
  
  This may have caused other processes in the application to be
  terminated by signals sent by orterun (as reported here).
