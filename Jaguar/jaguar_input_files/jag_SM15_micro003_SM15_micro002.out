Corrected results for 'protonated' structure in water:
pKa atom: 17

 # 	           Shell           	 pKa 	RMSD	 Contribution
---	---------------------------	-----	-----	--------------
1: 	imidazole as base          	 5.10	0.576	    42.64%
2: 	benzimidazole as base      	 4.79	0.662	    42.18%
3: 	heterocycle                	 4.26	0.837	    14.21%
4: 	Protonation of generic atom	 4.71	2.264	     0.97%

 Final weighted pKa value is 4.85
